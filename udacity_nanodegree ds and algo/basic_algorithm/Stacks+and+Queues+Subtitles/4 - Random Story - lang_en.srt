Hi there. I have a niece,

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:05,235
Mabel, who's almost three years old.

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:08,715
I used to love feeding her and carrying her around the park.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,860
Around the time she was two years old,

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,870
whenever I tried to spoon-feed her,

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,115
she would grab the spoon in one hand and say, "Mabel self."

7
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:20,290
Then she hold a spoon and try to feed herself.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,570
Same thing when I try to pick her up and take her to the park.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,430
She would start kicking her feet and saying, "Mabel walk."

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,190
Then once I put her on the ground,

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,155
she would start walking herself.

12
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,460
I think it's wonderful that she likes feeling independent.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,090
I think that when we're students and learning something new,

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,000
it's normal to feel stuck and it's tempting to want

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,380
someone to show us the way that will guarantee a solution.

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,660
But when we choose more independence and embrace a bit of struggle,

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,245
I think that even if we struggle and make mistakes,

18
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:53,025
we eventually find the answer.

19
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:55,550
The process helps us to feel more

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,255
confident in ourselves and leads to more meaningful learning.

21
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,480
Goodbye for now and good luck.
