we are using recursion for this problem

 base case : return True if we the user is found in group users
 else keep iterating the group using the recursion method
 
 
 Time complexity:
  we have used recursion to calculate the result
  so our time complexity will be equal to time complexity of our function is_user_in_group
  
  time complexity is increasing lineraly as we increase the number of sub groups
   so time complexity depends on the number of sub group
   so it is O(n)
   
   Linear time complexity
   
   
   space complexity:
   space will also depends on the group size and it will increase linearly with  that
   so space complexity is O(n)
   liner space complexity
