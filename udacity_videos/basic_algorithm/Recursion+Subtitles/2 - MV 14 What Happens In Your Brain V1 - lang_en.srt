00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,784
You've been busy learning here,

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:04,500
building up your knowledge and skills through your nanodegree work.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,935
But, what's actually happening inside your head to enable this growth?

4
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:09,964
Well, each time you think about something,

5
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:12,960
you activate particular neural pathways in your brain,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,680
and that activation strengthens the pathways themselves.

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,024
As a simple example,

8
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,199
if I just learned basic addition so that I can

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,839
figure out that three plus two equals five,

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,815
the more I do problems similar to this like,

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,370
one plus six equals seven,

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,940
the easier it will be for me to remember how to add digits together.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,429
Essentially, we grow our knowledge and make it easier to

14
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,715
access the more we recall relevant information.

15
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,340
Research also shows that applying new learning in

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,529
different contexts makes it even stronger,

17
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,060
and it allows you to retain it better.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,940
So, if I move from problems like three plus two equals

19
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,119
five to trying out something like 4 plus 20, plus 1,

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,509
plus 6, I have the opportunity to apply my addition skills in

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,189
a new context with bigger numbers and more things to add up.

22
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,509
This will make my brain distill the core concepts

23
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,479
necessary for understanding how addition really works,

24
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,949
which means that in the future,

25
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,140
when faced with even trickier addition problems,

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,894
I'll have a strong foundation to tackle those challenges.

27
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:09,015
This is exactly what we want to prepare you to do,

28
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:10,959
albeit with much tougher problems.

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,000
Our job at Udacity is to help you build deep knowledge and

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,019
flexible skills that you can apply to all sorts of novel problems in the future.

31
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,009
In order for that to happen your brain needs to actively engage with problems,

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,200
questions, and ideas that will push it to grow in the desired direction
