Run time analysis for each task

Task0 : T(1) =>  O(1) means the time is constant

Task1 : T(n) => O(n) means time is linear.
## we are iterating through each item in the list to check for unique numbers


Task2 :T(n) => O(n) means time is linear.
 we have two for loops (not nested)
 T(n) = n + n,
 T(n) = O(n)


Task3 : T(n) = O(nlogn) => O(nlogn) means time is Quasilinear
 we have used sorted function that has a time complexity of nlogn in both average and worst case
 T(n) = n + nlogn,
 T(n) = O(nlogn)


Task4: T(n) = O(nlogn) => O(nlogn) means time is Quasilinear
 we have to iterate 3 times and we have used sorted function that has a time complexity of nlogn in both average and worst case
 T(n) = n + n + n + nlogn,
 T(n) = O(nlogn)
