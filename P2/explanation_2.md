first we are finding the pivot point using binary search, 
with time complexity of O(logn)

after finding the pivot we are again using the binary search to find 
whether the elements exist or not and it has a time complexity of O(logn)

so overall time complexity is O(logn)


we have used few variables but the number of variables doesn't depend on the input size
so space complexity is O(1)
